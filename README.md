# Prompt-to-Production

**Prompt-to-Production** is an AI-inspired developer tool that generates production-ready FastAPI backends from natural language prompts. 

Even though this demo uses placeholder code, it demonstrates:

- Modular FastAPI project structure
- Automatic file generation
- Docker-ready environment
- Professional folder and code organization
- Scalable infrastructure-ready mindset

## How It Works

1. User types a prompt describing the API they want.
2. The generator creates:
   - `main.py` (FastAPI app)
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `README.md`
3. Project folder is ready to run locally or extend to full AI automation in future.

## Demo
